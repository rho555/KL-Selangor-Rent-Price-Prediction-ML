# KL and Selangor Apartment Rent Price Prediction

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning model that predicts apartment rent prices in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, Malaysia.  Using features like size, rooms, parking, and location, the XGBoost model is trained to estimate rental prices. Includes data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.
The model is built using the **XGBoost** algorithm and uses basic apartment features like size, rooms, parking, and location to estimate rental prices.

## How It Works

- Clean the dataset to remove unwanted characters.
- Train a machine learning model using apartment features.
- Predict rent prices based on input features.
